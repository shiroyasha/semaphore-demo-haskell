# An agent defines the environment in which your code runs.
# It is a combination of one of available machine types and operating
# system images. See:

# Blocks define the structure of a pipeline and are executed sequentially.
# Each block has a task that defines one or many parallel jobs. Jobs define
# the commands to execute.
